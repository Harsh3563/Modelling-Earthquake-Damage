# CE1015-Mini-Project 
# Dataset based on Modelling Earthquake damage
# Dataset source used for analysis: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/ 
# Objective: To build a code that analyses the given dataset, models and simulates the relationship between the ordinal-variable ('Damage_             grade') and the important predictors.
# Damage_grade represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:
  1: represents low damage
  2: represents a medium amount of damage
  3: represents almost complete destruction
# Approach:
  1. Basic Uni-Variate Analysis on response and predictor variables.
  2. One-Hot Encoding.
  3. Decision Tree Classifier.
  4. 'Feature Importance' by using a 'Random Forest'.Â 
  5. Bi-variate and Tri-variate analysis on damage-grade v/s the important predictors.
  6. A Simulator.
